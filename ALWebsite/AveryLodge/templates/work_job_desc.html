<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
<p>You are completely responsible for the satisfactory completion of your jobs. Ignorance is not an excuse. If you have questions find one of the Work Job Managers and ask him. If an accident or problem occurs because of your job, you are responsible.  If a supply is low for a job, be sure to check dry storage for more of that item(s) before complaining to the work job managers.   Be sure to use common sense whenever doing a job. If you are injured during a Work Job, inform the Cooperative-Director and Work Job Managers immediately.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Time</h2> 
<p>Jobs may not be confined to one hour. If circumstances require taking extra time or performing extra tasks on a job, it is your responsibility to fulfill the work job description, as you signed up for the job.  If you feel the job is grossly excessive due to added time required or added duties on a single, unusual occasion (i.e. a party on the patio hindering rear walk sweep or grossly excessive dishes for dinner dishes after a social), talk to Work Job Managers the about getting help or modifying duties.</p>
<br/> 
<h2>Term Clean</h2>
<p>Once per term all members are required to participate in a house wide cleaning project ("Term Clean"). This job is NOT optional and must be done by all members, except those exempt from doing Work Jobs. The Work Job Managers will determine the date of Term Clean. If you cannot participate on that date, then you MUST schedule an alternate date before Term Clean time slot sign ups are taken down; except in the case of an emergency, which will be determined by the discretion of the Work Job Managers.  You and the Work Job Managers will agree on a makeup time and day.  If it isn't completed by the agreed upon time allotted, you will be banked for a missed term clean ($40.00).</p>
<br/>  
<h2>Finals Week</h2>
<p>Just prior to finals week, a sign up will take place.  You will be required to sign up for two work jobs to be done the last week of school (Monday - Friday of finals week).  If you sign up for a job but finish finals earlier in the week and wish to leave, this is not an excuse for missing the job.  Trades occur this week as they would any other week, on the designated trade sheet.  A missed finals week work job is a $20.00 bank.  However, any individual missed by a finals week wakeup may bank the offender up to $40.00.  These jobs will start on the Monday and go through the Friday of finals week.</p>
<br/>  
<h2>Job Attendance</h2>
<p>There is no excuse for missing a job. If you are unable to do a job, you are responsible for finding someone to trade with. When you have found a trade, write it up on the job trade list. <strong>IF YOU DO NOT WRITE DOWN A TRADE ON THE DESIGNATED TRADE SHEET THEN THE TRADE DID NOT OCCUR FOR BANKING PURPOSES.</strong> If you will be late for a job, contact a Work Manager, or put a note in his mailbox.  You must ask a Work Manager to do a job early, and it is at their discretion whether they will let a job be done early. Work Job Managers will attempt to be as flexible as possible, but once a job is missed the house constitution requires that the Work Job Manager bank for a missed job. If a house member misses a job, he may be required to make up the job as well as whatever monetary discipline or work job is decided upon by JC. Failure to do a job correctly or missing a job altogether means that you are failing to do your fair share of work as a house member. If you have any questions about job policy, or anything else, please talk with your Work Managers.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Late Policy</h2>
<p>Jobs that require that you be on time will be considered missed if you are more than 10 minutes late. All other jobs should be completed within the specific time frame for that job. Excuses will be granted on a case-by-case basis, but will not be granted week after week.  If you know that you will be late for a job, you must inform the Work Job Managers prior to being late for the job.  Excuses given after the fact will not be accepted or considered.
Appealing Banks
<br/><br/>
If you feel that a bank isn't correct, bring your concerns to JC, not the Work Job Managers.  JC's job is to decide the merit of banks, so they are the ones that must be appealed to, not the Work Job Managers.  The ONLY time appealing a bank directly to a Work Job Manager is valid is when he has banked the wrong person for the job.</p>
<br/><br/>
<h2>Wake-Up 1 and 2</h2>
There is a Wake-up 1 and 2 training course of sorts ask the Work Job Managers for details.

<h2>Grill Clean Instructions</h2>
1.Scrape the chunks off with the scraper.
2.Pour vinegar on the grill, and spread it around with the scraper.
3.Begin scrubbing with the grill brick. (a)
4.When the vinegar has evaporated or you're just pushing grit around on the grill, scrape it off.
5.Pour more vinegar (b) on the grill, spread it around, and scrub it.
6.When you're just pushing grit around the grill or your lubricant of choice has been absorbed, scrape it off.
7.Repeat until the surface is clean of any stains or discolorations.
8.Take a shard of an old grill brick, and scrub the backsplash surround, and front thingy until they're free of deposits. Don't bother using oil or vinegar for this step.
9.Scrape the resultant grit into the grease catch-pan. Push all the oil and grit down the hole.
10.Scrub the catch-pan with the grill brick, scraping any splashes off of the surface.
11.Clean all the grit and ash off of the scraper.
12.Pour a liberal amount of oil on the surface and scrape it clean with the scraper, wiping the edge of the scraper off between scrapes, squeegee-style.
13.Rub off the surface with paper towels, taking care to remove all traces of grit and ash.
14.If the grill has a slightly brown color, repeat these last two steps.
15.Pull out the grease tray below the grill, and empty it into the barrel behind the dumpster and replace the tin foil.
16.Pour a small amount of oil on the grill, and spread it around so that the entire surface is covered.  Wipe with a paper towel and check for towel for any discolorations.  If there are any, you’re not done.  Wipe down grill with paper towels and reapply oil.  Repeat this step until paper towels show no discoloration.
(a) Scrub the flat side of a grill brick along the "grain" of the metal, in this case, along the length of the grill. Scrubbing across the grain will scratch the metal. For best results, use a fresh side of the brick, one with a visible "honeycomb" structure. Push down hard on the brick, trying to get as much off as you can with each stroke. If you're not breaking a sweat, you're not doing it very well.
 (b)Way too many people argue about whether it's better to use oil or vinegar on a grill. Vinegar is quite a bit more effective at breaking up deposits and the like, but it smells rank and requires about 3 times as much. Oil is best for getting out grease, but must be used in the right amounts to be very effective. It's really a matter of personal preference. Try them both and decide which you like, and don't be afraid to make adjustments depending on what sort of mess is on the grill. There are only four real rules:
Never use them both at the same time
Always use oil for your last pass.
Never take the cook's supplies. Use only the jugs under the sink marked “Grill Clean”.
Never use anything but Vinegar or Oil, doing so will damage the grill.
Grill Cleanliness Guidelines:
Clean: Metal colored with little or no brown coloration: Refresh Oil if needed
Fair: Majority light brown in color: Start on Step 13 above
Dirty: Majority dark brown or black: Start on Step 1 above
